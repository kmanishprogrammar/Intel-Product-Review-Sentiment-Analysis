Great for gambling. Even to AMD beats it in many core jobs don't mean it's not a good processor. It's a stable relative processor. And best of all it's in stock.

Forwardmore, you can get away with a moderate cooling solution on the 12700k where the 12900k really requires a top of the line cooler which will also set you back. Even while using the NH-D15 CPU cooler I decided to subclock the 12900k a little bit in order to keep thermals in check, bringing the performance closer to the 12700k.

Marvelably designed CPU. For those who want low power consumption and low time just leave it stock. The 3.6 Ghz to 5.0 boost is designed to make this processor the Swiss Army Knife of CPUs. Overclocks to 5.1 all-core easily on the Z590 parentboards. Yes it runs warm but you wanted and sorry to buy that 360mm AIO. Two courses can overclock to 5.2 if desired. Probably get all 8 pretty close to that with an open loop system. Scores 116-118% on userwatches. In like AMD but they just don't overclock as well.

For those who suspect to mount it for a Gaming computer, you don't think so much about it. Buy this processor and you'll save a card and a mother card a bit better. Be aware that in Gaming's performance the graphics does almost all the work.

"Since installing this pcu I have been sturgling with system stability. Not painted the wrong down yet, so it may be a false cpu.

"The core core is the core of the 12th generation of Intel, based on the Alder Lake architecture.

It is a major processor without integrated graphics circuit, which involves the use of a dedicated graphics card. The core i-12400F has 6 high performances (P-Core) and 12 threads, thanks to the Hyperreading technology. It displays a base frequency of 2.5 GHz and may reach up to 4.4 GHz in Turbo mode.

"If it has the money to save and want a processor that'll last you at least 5 years (and are a power user like I am) itss a good choice. But most people say the advantages over the 13700k aren't worth it most. If you're just using the PC as a high-end gambling rich and i7-13700k is more than enough than a 4090 GPU. This processor is designed to benefit more advanced users so I'd save the 150$ and get the earner 13700k.

It is a major processor without integrated graphics circuit, which involves the use of a dedicated graphics card.

Value and CSGO frames are very high, and I never get any slow down or mouse input it feels great! So a lot of people said this new Intel ran very hot and I don't even hit over 65c at full load having it overclocked to 5.2ghz. Now i do have one of the best AIR coolers out there even if you have a cooler that is not looking at safe and normal time even when overclocked to 5.2 gz.",positive
"I previously Purchased the 13th Gen version of this processor and it had a defect. Intel was very good at getting a return sent via RMA, although it took anyway. I Purchased this version instead and was pleasantly surprised to see all of my issues solved. The CPU can handle everything at it. Certainly a good purchase and better than the 13th genes that seem to have more issues.",positive
"One of the best CPUs at the performance/price report level I think. I have overclocked it easily to 5.1Ghz for 1.34V (not yet tested), and with a 50-euro based watercooling it stays around 70 degrees in the game. You need to know that if you play at 140p or more, you will not see almost any difference with an i9,9900K for example, so if you only play, i5,9600K is excellent and overclock with more ease than the above models (lower heating).

Intel last-minute scaled this CPU back because of conflicts with the old 14nm process. At launch, this CPU was a terrible value. As of now, if you shop around you can find this CPU bound with a Z590 motherboard at a very fair price. I got into mine for under $410.00 with an ITX motherboard.

As for gambling, it'll run many older games at a high FPS even without any help from a GPU, and it handles modern titles without any problem, too.

"I bought this processor to set up a game PC for my son and I am very pleased. A quality-price report is hard to beat. The processor in this version (f) does not have a graphics chip. So it needs to buy a separate graphics card. This I3 12100f has only four hearts and eight threads, which can limit its performance in more serious tasks such as video performance or high-level game. It does not take overlocking, which means that you cannot increase the CPU's clock speed beyond its base specifications. But at this price, it remains a strong choice for those who have a limited budget and who are looking for a platform.",negative
